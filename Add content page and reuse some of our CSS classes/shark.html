<h1> This is the biggest shark ever - Whale Shark</h1>
<img class="imagec" src="WhaleShark.jpg">
<p class="paragraph">The whale shark holds the title of the world's biggest shark species. Growing to a length of about 65 feet (the length of about 1 1/2 school buses!) and weighing about 75,000 pounds, this streamlined fish is really a gentle giant.

 Some areas frequented by these sharks, such as Ningaloo Reef, Australia, have become popular tourist destinations because of their swim-with-sharks programs.

Whale sharks live in tropical and warmer temperate waters in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.

In addition to their size, these sharks can be easily recognized by their gorgeous coloration, which is formed from lighter spots and stripes over a gray, blue or brown skin. They also have very wide mouths, which they use to eat tiny prey, primarily plankton, crustaceans and small fish, which are filtered from the water as the shark swims.
